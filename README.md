# Project Title: Developing Predictive Models for Crop Yield Estimation in India

## Introduction

Crop yield estimation is a critical aspect of agriculture, influencing food security, economic stability, and resource allocation. In a country like India, where agriculture is a cornerstone of the economy, accurate crop yield prediction is essential. As climate change intensifies, adaptive farming practices become crucial, making precise yield predictions even more valuable. However, this process often faces challenges due to the country's vast geographical diversity, varying climatic conditions, and evolving agricultural practices. Moreover, small farmers face challenges such as limited access to modern agriculture, unpredictable weather, and resource constraints. Developing predictive models for crop yield estimation in India is imperative to address these challenges effectively.

### Problem Statement

The primary problem at hand is to develop predictive models for crop yield estimation in India that can provide accurate and timely forecasts, considering diverse geographical, climatic, and agronomic factors. Accurate crop yield estimation is essential for farmers, policymakers, and the agricultural sector. It helps in making informed decisions regarding planting, resource allocation, and food distribution. This project aims to address the challenge of predicting rice crop yields based on multiple factors, including fertilizer usage, seedling quantity, land preparation methods, and irrigation techniques.

### Business Understanding

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning solution to predict the crop yield per acre of rice or wheat crops in India. The project's goal is to empower small-scale farmers and break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition. India is a nation with high population density, most of whom are small-scale farmers that rely on agriculture as a source of income and as a source of food as well. It is crucial for the government of India to help small-scale farmers maximize their potential when it comes to food production. The agriculture sector in India is vast and diverse, with millions of farmers relying on it for their livelihoods. Accurate crop yield estimation can help in:

- Ensuring food security for the country's growing population.
- Efficiently managing resources, such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides.
- Enabling informed policy decisions related to agriculture.
- Mitigating the impact of climate change on crop production.
- Enhancing the income and living standards of farmers.

### Data Understanding

#### Data Sources

The dataset used in this project has been obtained from Digital Green and was collected through a survey conducted across multiple districts in India. It consists of a variety of factors that could potentially impact the yield of rice crops. These factors include things like the type and amount of fertilizers used, the quantity of seedlings planted, methods of preparing the land, different irrigation techniques employed, among other features. The dataset comprises more than 5000 data points, each having more than 40 features.

#### Data Size

The dataset is divided into two parts: `Train` and `Test`. The `Train` dataset contains the target variable (Yield) and is used to train the predictive models. The `Test` dataset resembles the `Train` dataset but does not include the target variable. This separation is essential to simulate real-world scenarios where crop yields are not known in advance.

- Train dataset: 3870 rows and 44 columns
- Test dataset: 1290 rows and 43 columns

#### Data Exploration

The data exploration phase involved several steps, including:

- Identifying unique districts and blocks where agriculture is practiced.
- Analyzing the methods used in land preparation.
- Comparing the Cultivated Land and Crop Cultivated Land variables to understand the disparities in land usage.
- Examining the methods used in harvesting and threshing.

#### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning phase involved checking for duplicate rows in the "ID" column, and it was found that there were no duplicates. Additionally, missing values in the dataset were identified.

### Models and Approaches

Several models and approaches will be used to predict crop yields:

- **Statistical Models:** These models will use historical data on crop yields, weather patterns, soil characteristics, and other relevant factors to make predictions. Time series analysis is an example of a statistical method that will be applied.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks will be used to analyze complex interactions between various factors affecting crop yields.

- **Crop Simulation Models:** Crop simulation models like DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) and APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) simulate the growth of crops based on input data like weather, soil, and management practices. They can predict yields under different scenarios.

### Libraries and Tools

The project utilizes various libraries and tools for data analysis and model development. These include but are not limited to:

## Model Comparison

In this section, you can compare the performance of the different machine learning models you've used for crop yield prediction. Create a table or visual representation that summarizes the key evaluation metrics for each model, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²) values. This comparison will help readers understand which model performed best and why it was chosen for further use.

Here's an example of how you can structure this section:

### Model Performance Comparison
