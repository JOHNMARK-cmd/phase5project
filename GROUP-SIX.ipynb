    "## INTRODUCTION.\n",
    "***\n",
    "Crop yield estimation is a critical aspect of agriculture, influencing food security, economic stability, and resource allocation. In a country like India, where agriculture is a cornerstone of the economy, accurate crop yield prediction is essential. As climate change intensifies, adaptive farming practices become crucial, making precise yield predictions even more valuable. However, this process often faces challenges due to the country's vast geographical diversity, varying climatic conditions, and evolving agricultural practices. Moreover, small farmers face challenges such as limited access to modern agriculture, unpredictable weather, and resource constraints. Developing predictive models for crop yield estimation in India is imperative to address these challenges effectively.\n",

    "* N\\B: One of the key questions that arises concerns the ability of this system to provide profitable and actionable changes in the economy for small scale, large scale farmers, citizens and the government as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is at the heart of this project, where I delve into the realm of statistical and machine learning analysis to uncover insights that can shape the future of the agricultural sector. The focus is on the Indian agricultural sector, which dedicated in providing sufficient food supply to its ever growing population. By harnessing the power of statistical data analysis and machine learning, Romeo Six Labs aims to provide its stakeholders with the tools to correctly predict farming patterns and provide solutions food crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Digital Green comprehensive data-set from various districts in India, focusing on factors influencing rice crop yield, this project is aimed at developing predictive models for crop yield estimation using this valuable data-set. A crop yield model could revolutionise Indian agriculture, and serve as a global model for smallholder farmers. Accurate yield predictions empower smallholder farmers to make informed planting and resource allocation decisions, reducing poverty and malnutrition and improving food security. \n",
    "Solutions developed here can drive sustainable agriculture and ensure a stable food supply for the world's growing population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using data, can we predict target? This would be useful because rationale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why would it be valuable to be able to predict this target? Who would find this model useful? How accurate does the model need to be in order to serve the stated purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution to predict the crop yield per acre of rice or wheat crops in India. Our goal is to empower these farmers and break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project offers data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts a unique chance to make a real difference in vulnerable populations' lives while advancing global food security in a concise, impactful way.\n",

    "## DATA UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "The data-set has been downloaded from zindi and was collected through a survey conducted across multiple districts in India. It consists of a variety of factors that could potentially impact the yield of rice crops. These factors include things like the type and amount of fertilizers used, the quantity of seedlings planted, methods of preparing the land, different irrigation techniques employed, among other features. The dataset comprises more than 5000 data points, each having more than 40 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data size\n",
    "The dataset is divided into three: Train contains the target. This is the dataset that we will use to train our models. Test resembles Train.csv but without the target-related columns. This is the dataset on which you will apply your model to. The variable dataset has variables found in train and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models. \n",
    "There are several models and approaches that will be used to predict crop yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistical Models: These model will use historical data on crop yields, weather patterns, soil characteristics, and other relevant factors to make predictions. Time series analysis is an example of statistical method that will be applied.\n",
